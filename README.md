# Workflow Automation – Trip Pricing Calculator

This repository contains a simple Excel tool I created to help organize trip pricing for a car service company. The goal is to reduce manual mistakes and speed up the process of calculating the final charge for each trip.

## 📊 Trip_Pricing_Calculator.xlsx

The spreadsheet includes fields for:

- Base fare  
- Flat charge  
- Hourly job  
- Waiting charge (based on hourly rate)  
- Stop charges  
- Fuel surcharge  
- Parking  
- Tolls  
- Service fee  
- Tax (%)  

The **Grand Total** cell automatically adds all the amounts and applies the tax percentage.

## 🎯 Why I made this

I work in a fleet/car service environment where we handle a lot of trip pricing and adjustments. Doing everything by hand can lead to small errors and takes extra time, so I built this basic calculator to make the process more consistent and easier to manage.

This is a small project, but it's my first step toward using simple automation and spreadsheets to improve everyday workflows.
